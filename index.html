                "The Kahal is the organization of the Jewish nation. It is the
                result of the Talmudic dogma of Chosen People, the doctrine under
                which the Jews should not merge with other nations, because God has
                promised them to have all the earth and to rule the world... The
                Kahal organization is mysterious which, wrapped in the innocuous
                appearance of religious communities, made possible the preservation
                of the Jewish people, amid strong nations which he broke, or is on
                the road to destroy."
